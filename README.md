HR Analytics Dashboard Project Description
This project focused on transforming raw employee data into strategic insights to improve workforce stability and efficiency, demonstrating proficiency in data transformation, visualization, and strategic HR reporting.

1. Project Goal and Scope
The primary objective was to establish a comprehensive HR dashboard to monitor critical workforce metrics, specifically focusing on identifying and mitigating high-risk areas like employee attrition. The analysis covered over 1,000 employee records across various departments and demographics.

2. Data Transformation and Integrity (ETL)
ETL Process: Rigorous ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes were executed using Power Query to clean, standardize, and shape the raw employee records. This was critical for ensuring data consistency across multiple dimensions (e.g., standardizing job titles, handling missing tenure data).

Data Modeling: The cleaned data was structured using effective data modeling techniques within Power BI to establish clear relationships between dimension (employee details) and fact tables (salary/attrition events), optimizing query performance.

3. Core Analysis and Strategic Impact
Attrition Risk Identification: The dashboard highlighted a company-wide attrition rate of 18%. Crucially, the analysis pinpointed a disproportionately high risk in the Sales division, which showed an attrition rate of 40%—more than double the company average.

Strategic Impact: This finding enabled the hypothetical HR department to implement targeted retention strategies specifically for the Sales division, focusing efforts and resources where the risk and potential cost savings were highest.

Key Metrics: The dashboard successfully presented over 10 actionable metrics, including average salary trends ($65K average salary), tenure analysis, and detailed demographic distributions.

4. Tools and Deliverables
Tools: Power BI, DAX, Power Query.

Deliverable: A comprehensive, interactive HR dashboard built in Power BI, utilizing DAX calculations for advanced time-based workforce analysis and KPI tracking.
